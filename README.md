# Synaptory Fractal Traveler
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3591847-c76d-46a2-bf01-4508a4bc7032)


Interactive fractal explorer that lets you explore the mesmerizing depths of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Built with modern JavaScript and WebGL, this app provides smooth animations and intuitive controls, allowing you to travel through intricate fractal landscapes with ease. Developed for the [Unmasking Chaos](https://open.substack.com/pub/synaptory/p/unmasking-chaos?r=2qbtpc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) article on my Substack blog.

> [!IMPORTANT]
**High-end GPU is recommended!**


### Live app is available [here](https://fractal.brnka.com).

## Features
- **Interactive Exploration:**
Explore the high resolution fractal plane via mouse, multi-touch gestures or keyboard. Fractals can be zoomed, panned, rotated and changed in real-time.

- **Smooth Animations:**
Enjoy smooth transitions with animations that dynamically interpolate between states.

- **Preset Views ad Dives:**
Instantly travel to a series of predefined fractal presets using dedicated buttons or enjoy animated dives into well selected intricate regions and watch them to evolve in real time. 

- **Responsive UI:**
Designed with both desktop and mobile users in mind, featuring touch-friendly controls and dynamic resizing.

- **Modern Development:**
Uses WebGL for rendering, ES6 for a modular codebase, and webpack for bundling and production optimization. Unit tests are implemented with Jest to ensure robust functionality.

- **Extensibility:**
The architecture supports additional fractal types and further customization of rendering options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm (or yarn)

### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fractal-traveler.git`
2. `cd fractal-traveler`
3. `npm install`

### Usage:
- `npm run start` to start localhost webserver and run the app (`localhost:8080`)
- `npm run build` for production build (minified files, FTP deploy without maps using .env configuration)
- `npm run dev-nowatch` for local build without watch mode (incl. source maps)

### v1.3
- This version contains the directory and build structure, previous versions were simple PoCs

## Structure
- `fractalRenderer.js`:
This module defines a fractalRenderer abstract class that encapsulates the WebGL code, including shader compilation, drawing, reset, and screenToFractal conversion. It also includes common animation methods.

- `mandelbrotRenderer.js`:
This module defines a MandelbrotRenderer class that inherits from fractalRenderer, implements the shader fragment code for the Mandelbrot set fractal and sets preset zoom-ins.

- `juliaRenderer.js`:
  This module defines a JuliaRenderer class that inherits from fractalRenderer, implements the shader fragment code for the Julia set fractal and sets preset zoom-ins.

- `mouseEventHandlers.js`:
This module exports a function registerTouchEventHandlers that sets up all mouse events. It interacts directly with the fractalRenderer instance.

- `touchEventHandlers.js`:
This module exports a function registerTouchEventHandlers that sets up all touch events. It interacts directly with the fractalRenderer instance.

- `ui.js`:
Contains code to manage the UI (header interactions, buttons, infoText update, etc.).

- `utils.js`:
Contains helper functions for working with URL parameters, colors, etc.

- `main.js`:
The entry point that imports modules, creates the fractal renderer instance (passing the canvas ID), registers events, initializes the UI and the fractal.

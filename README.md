Interactive fractal explorer that lets you explore the mesmerizing depths of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Built with modern JavaScript and WebGL, this app provides smooth animations and intuitive controls, allowing you to travel through intricate fractal landscapes with ease. Developed for the [Unmasking Chaos](https://open.substack.com/pub/synaptory/p/unmasking-chaos?r=2qbtpc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) article on my Substack blog.

## Features
### Interactive Exploration
Explore the high-resolution fractal plane via mouse, multitouch gestures, or keyboard. Fractals can be zoomed, panned, rotated, and changed in real-time.

### Smooth Animations
Enjoy smooth transitions with animations that dynamically interpolate between states.

### Preset Views ad Dives
Instantly travel to a series of predefined fractal presets using dedicated buttons or enjoy animated dives into well selected intricate regions and watch them to evolve in real time. 

### Responsive UI
Designed with both desktop and mobile users in mind, featuring touch-friendly controls and dynamic resizing.

### Modern Development
Uses WebGL for rendering, ES6 for a modular codebase, and webpack for bundling and production optimization. Unit tests are implemented with Jest to ensure robust functionality.

### Extensibility
The architecture supports additional fractal types and further customization of rendering options.
